PROJECT TITLE: Tic Tac Toe Game
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: To design a Tic Tac Toe Game that allows two players (one human and one computer) to
		    alternate placing marks in a 3X3 board. The first player, who's respective mark is X,
		    is decided by a coin toss. A win is achieved by filling a row, a column, or a diagonal
		    with one kind of mark. If neither player can achieve a win, the game ends with a tie.
VERSION or DATE: 4/16/2021

			   achieved. Type Y to begin a fresh game, and n to quit. Enjoy!

<pros>: This was by far the best project I have ever done. Words cannot describe the joy I had while completing
	this project. I am planning on further working on this program during later holidays and teh summer in 
	order to add time delays between player move's, computer move's, and diplays of the board. 

	I am also planing on adding sound effects and a seperate multiplayer mode. Perhaps, by next year, I would 
	be able to create an app that uses the code I created and graphics and sfx from the MIT free app creater.
	The possibilities are limitless, but I am sure I would have an immesurable amount of fun throughout it all.

<cons>: I felt the comments which were in the files provided for the project where a bit lackluster and confusing.
	During my first read through of the comments, I thought that the player who goes first should continue 
	making moves until they hit a win, without the second player getting a chance to make a single move. I wish
	the words "alternating moves" or "one mark placed per turn" were used to elaborate on the structure of the game
	being designed by students.
